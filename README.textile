Suggested usage:

Download and install "appswitch":http://sabi.net/nriley/software/#appswitch.

"Download":http://github.com/nriley/keyboardViewer/downloads and install keyboardViewer:

pre. sudo install keyboardViewer /usr/local/bin

Trigger with an AppleScript or shell script, e.g.:

pre. do shell script "/usr/local/bin/appswitch -qi com.apple.KeyboardViewer || /usr/local/bin/keyboardViewer"

The above will show Keyboard Viewer if it’s not running, and close it if it isn’t.

I run the above script from "FastScripts":http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/.

This isn’t necessary on Mac OS X 10.5 because simply opening KeyboardViewerServer does the same thing.
