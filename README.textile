Suggested usage:

"Download":http://github.com/nriley/keyboardViewer/downloads and install keyboardViewer:

bc. sudo install keyboardViewer /usr/local/bin

Trigger with an AppleScript or shell script, e.g.:

bc. tell application "System Events"
	if exists (process "Keyboard Viewer") then
		click process "Keyboard Viewer"'s window 1's buttons whose subrole is "AXCloseButton"
	else
		do shell script "/usr/local/bin/keyboardViewer"
	end if
end tell

The above will show Keyboard Viewer if it’s not running, and close it if it isn’t.

I run the above script from "FastScripts":http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/.

The keyboardViewer utility isn’t necessary on Mac OS X 10.5 because simply opening KeyboardViewerServer does the same thing.
